 * Compat-wireless notes for USB backport stuff:
 *
 * urb->reject exists on 2.6.27, the poison/unpoison helpers
 * did not though. The anchor poison does not exist so we cannot use them.
 *
 * USB anchor poising seems to exist to prevent future driver sumbissions
 * of usb_anchor_urb() to an anchor marked as poisoned. For older kernels
 * we cannot use that, so new usb_anchor_urb()s will be anchored. The down
 * side to this should be submission of URBs will continue being anchored
 * on an anchor instead of having them being rejected immediately when the
 * driver realized we needed to stop. For ar9170 we poison URBs upon the
 * ar9170 mac80211 stop callback(), don't think this should be so bad.
 * It mean there is period of time in older kernels for which we continue
 * to anchor new URBs to a known stopped anchor. We have two anchors
 * (TX, and RX)

/**
 * usb_poison_urb - reliably kill a transfer and prevent further use of an URB
 * @urb: pointer to URB describing a previously submitted request,
 *	may be NULL
 *
 * This routine cancels an in-progress request.  It is guaranteed that
 * upon return all completion handlers will have finished and the URB
 * will be totally idle and cannot be reused.  These features make
 * this an ideal way to stop I/O in a disconnect() callback.
 * If the request has not already finished or been unlinked
 * the completion handler will see urb->status == -ENOENT.
 *
 * After and while the routine runs, attempts to resubmit the URB will fail
 * with error -EPERM.  Thus even if the URB's completion handler always
 * tries to resubmit, it will not succeed and the URB will become idle.
 *
 * This routine may not be used in an interrupt context (such as a bottom
 * half or a completion handler), or when holding a spinlock, or in other
 * situations where the caller can't schedule().
 *
 * This routine should not be called by a driver after its disconnect
 * method has returned.
